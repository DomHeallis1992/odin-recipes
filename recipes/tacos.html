    <p>Don’t miss these succulent Birria Tacos, with the authentic flavors of Mexico. They're easy to prepare with GOYA® Corn Tortillas that come ready to use, along with delicious GOYA® Chiles: Pasilla and Ancho, which adds a fantastic touch as well as color and a light spiciness to the meat and consommé. Before serving, first dip the tortillas in the consommé and heat them in a skillet, adding the meat. Finally, fold the tortillas to form the taco and brown them on both sides. When it's time to eat, serve them with more consommé for dipping bite after bite... a delight!</p>
